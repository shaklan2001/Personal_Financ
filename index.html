                    <p>Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It
                        encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, retirement planning, and tax
                        and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial
                        services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment
                        opportunities.
                        At a very basic level, personal financial management simply means gaining an understanding of
                        your financial situation in order to make the most of your assets in day-to-day life and in
                        planning for your future.

                    <p>Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Chances are your vision includes some degree of financial
                        security — vacations to Europe, perhaps, or a nice car. At the very least, you'll want enough
                        room in your budget to go out to dinner or buy a concert ticket without financial angst. As
                        college costs have risen, so have the debt loads of young adults.
                        The number of first-time homebuyers has fallen to a generational low as young workers find their
                        personal balance sheets weighed down by student debt. In other words, you'll pay the price for —
                        or reap the rewards of — today's financial decisions years from now.

                    <br>
                    <p>Your first step in creating a budget will be to track your expenses. There are a number of ways
                        to do this, so it all depends on what you find easiest. Many people use a spreadsheet to record
                        everything they spend money on, while others might make a list of their purchases. We recommend
                        checking your credit card account statements every month to see what you’ve spent and in what
                        categories. Once you determine your fixed costs (tuition payments, rent, meal plans, etc.),
                        you’ll have a better idea of how much you have left to spend on a monthly basis.

                    <p>One way you can loosen your budget and have a little extra money on hand is to cut down on costs.
                        There are tons of ways to do this, some of which you might already be doing. We also have some
                        great ideas on passive income for students to help you bring in some extra cash.
                        Always buy used textbooks instead of new ones (and resell those textbooks when you’re done),
                        skip the expensive on-campus meal plan and cook yourself instead, or shop at thrift stores to
                        save on new clothes. By the way, also check out our key tips on how to create a college student

                    <p>When you’re creating a budget, it’s imperative to dedicate a portion of your expenses to
                        emergency savings. This may take away from some of your discretionary spending, but it will be
                        worth it in the end.

                        <br>
                        <p>Only 41% of Americans have enough saved away for a $1,000 emergency, which can put you in an
                            extremely dangerous place. Simply put, you never know what unexpected medical or repair bill
                            will come up.
                            If you don’t have the cash on hand to cover it, you may need to pull it from your tuition
                            fund or use a credit card to cover the costs. Needless to say, this can have drastic
                            consequences for your future like dropping your credit score or throwing you into debt.

                    <br>
                    <p>Student savings accounts are a great place to store your money while getting a little something
                        back. Key things to look for? Make sure any account you open has no minimum balance requirement
                        and no fees.
                        Online features may also be helpful, since you’ll likely be away from home during the semester.
                        Plus, online banks often have higher interest rates, earning you more passive cash.

                    <br>
                    <p>If you can find a good rate, CDs or bonds are good for the money that you don’t need to touch for
                        a few years. CD stands for certificate of deposit, and it’s a type of investment that gives you
                        a fixed term (generally between three months and five years) with a fixed interest rate. You’ll
                        get your money back plus interest at the end of the term.
                        Bonds are similar, but they’re not issued by banks. Instead, they’re offered by the government
                        or other companies looking to raise funds. Like certificates of deposit (CDs), they come with
                        fixed terms and interest rates.

                                    Once you have a full picture of your budget, you can start making changes. You'll

                                    A budget isn't static, so make a plan to revisit it once or twice a year, especially
